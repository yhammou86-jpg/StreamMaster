## Before you upload

- **Audio is silent by design.** Add trending audio in the YouTube app
  (Shorts → edit → Add sound). Shorts with licensed audio get pushed harder
  than uploads with no track.
- **First frame is dark** — if you want a custom thumbnail, use `promo/p012.6.png`
  (the logo frame) rather than a text frame.
- **Vertical only.** If you also want a 16:9 version for a normal upload,
  the layout needs a horizontal variant — ask and it's a quick re-render.

## Re-rendering

```bash
cd promo && python render.py
```

Timeline lives in the `SCENES` list at the bottom of `render.py`; each entry is
`(start_seconds, duration, function)`. Preview a single frame without encoding:

```bash
python -c "import render as R; R.render_frame(12.6).save('check.png')"
```
