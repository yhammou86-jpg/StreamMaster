# Hydra

**One addon. Every source.** A Stremio / Nuvio addon that aggregates public trackers and Torznab
indexers, probes your debrid cache in a single batch call, and falls back to native P2P — so there
is always something to press play on.

Runs entirely on Vercel's free tier. Zero runtime dependencies.

## What a result looks like

Every card carries one fact per line, so a choice takes a glance instead of a decode:

```
⚡ TB
🔥 4K | ⚡ Cached | 🛰️ 6.71 GB
🎬 Sugar ▸ S02E03 · Shibboleth
💎 WEB-DL · x265 · DV
🔊 Atmos · DD+
📚 TorBox Library · ABC
```

Switch to `style: compact` for a single line. No image badges: no client renders markdown images
reliably in a stream title, so Hydra uses Unicode glyphs only — the same approach AIOStreams takes.

---

## Why this is different

Most addons that get popular on a VPS fall apart on serverless, because they assume a long-running
process with a warm cache and unlimited time. Hydra is designed around the opposite constraint, and
that constraint turns out to be an advantage:

| Problem on serverless | Hydra's answer |
|---|---|
| No database for user config | Config lives compressed in the URL (`~310 bytes`) |
| 10–60 s function limit | Deadline-budgeted scraping, returns partial results instead of failing |
| Cold starts | Zero dependencies — pure Node built-ins, no SDK/axios/cheerio |
| No persistent cache | Per-instance LRU + single-flight, which covers the real traffic pattern |
| N debrid API calls per result | **One** batched `checkcached` call for up to 100 hashes |
| Debrid account filled with dead torrents | **Lazy resolve** — a torrent is only added when you press play |
| Can't seed torrents from a lambda | **Native P2P** — return an infohash, let the client do the work |
| Trackers blocked unevenly by network | **Source diagnostics** — probe them, keep the ones that answer |

Three details worth calling out:

**Lazy resolution.** Stream URLs point at Hydra (`/r/<infohash>`), not at your debrid account. On
play, Hydra registers the magnet (instant, because it is cached), picks the right file inside the
torrent, mints a direct link, and 302-redirects you there. Browsing 40 results costs exactly one
debrid request.

**Ranking that respects physics.** A 4K REMUX with one seeder is not better than a 1080p WEB-DL with
ninety — it just buffers forever. Seed count feeds the score as a liveness penalty, and cached
results skip that penalty entirely because the service serves them from disk.

**Informed choice over a fixed list.** Public trackers are fragile and fail asymmetrically: a source
dead from one datacenter is fine from another. Rather than guess, the setup page runs a live probe
and shows you what each source returned, with latency. Keep the winners.

## Deploy in five minutes

### 1. Push to GitHub

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<you>/hydrastream.git
cd hydrastream
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/<you>/hydrastream.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Import into Vercel

1. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new) and import the repository.
2. Framework preset: **Other**. Build command: leave empty. Output directory: leave empty.
3. (Optional) Add environment variable `CONFIG_SECRET` — see below.
4. Deploy.

That is it. Vercel detects `api/*.js` as serverless functions and serves `public/` as static files.
No build step, no `npm install`, nothing to compile.

### 3. Install the addon

Open `https://<your-project>.vercel.app/configure`, work through the four steps, and use
**Direct Install** (opens the app), **Manifest URL** (paste into Nuvio), or **Download**.

---

## Local development

```bash
npm run dev     # http://localhost:7000
npm test        # 19 assertions, no framework
```

`npm run dev` runs a dependency-free HTTP server that mirrors the Vercel routing table exactly, so
what you test locally is what you deploy. There is nothing to install.

## Configuration reference

Everything below is set through `/configure` and encoded into the addon URL.

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `svc` | `torbox` · `realdebrid` |
| `key` | API key for the selected service. Optional. |
| `mode` | `hybrid` (cached via debrid, rest P2P) · `debrid` (debrid only) · `p2p` (never contact it) |
| `style` | `rich` (one fact per line) · `compact` (single line) |
| `providers` | Per-source toggles |
| `res` | Allowed resolutions: `4k` `1080p` `720p` `480p` |
| `max` | Max results returned (5–100) |
| `minSeed` | Minimum seeders |
| `noCam` | Drop CAM / TS / screener releases |
| `strictMatch` | Drop releases that are a different film (default on). Turn off to see everything. |
| `hideUnreleased` | Drop everything when the film has not opened or the episode has not aired (default on). |
| `sort` | `quality` · `seeders` · `size` |
| `cachedOnly` | Only show what the service can serve right now |
| `uncached` | Allow the service to fetch uncached torrents on play (slow first play) |
| `preferEfficient` | Slight boost for x265 / AV1 encodes |
| `lang` | Preferred language tag, e.g. `ita` |
| `proxy` | Fetch sources through a proxy. Prefix (`https://w.dev/?url=`) or template (`https://w.dev/f/{url}`). Fixes TLS-fingerprint blocks. |
| `torznab` | `{ url, key }` — Jackett / Prowlarr / any Newznab feed |
| `prowlarr` | `{ url, key }` — Prowlarr's aggregate JSON API |

### Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `CONFIG_SECRET` | no | Encrypts the config blob with AES-256-GCM. Changing it invalidates existing URLs. |
| `PORT` | no | Local dev port (default `7000`). |

---

## Debrid services

| Service | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **TorBox** | stable | Verified end-to-end against the live API. Batch `checkcached` handles 100 hashes per call. |
| **Real-Debrid** | beta | Follows the documented v1 API. Not exercised against a live account during development, so treat it as untested until you confirm with your own key. |
| Premiumize, AllDebrid, PikPak, OffCloud | not yet | Shown in the setup grid so the shape of the product is clear. |

Adding a service is deliberately small — implement two functions in `src/debrid/<name>.js` and
register it in `src/debrid/index.js`:

```js
async function checkCached(key, hashes) -> Set<infohash>   // which are instant
async function resolve(key, hash, hint, opts) -> string    // a direct HTTPS URL
```

---

## Sources

| Source | Tier | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Knaben** | 1 | Meta-search over dozens of trackers, with *live* seeders. Carries most of the weight. |
| **YTS** | 1 | Movies, small high-quality encodes. IMDb-addressable. |
| **EZTV** | 1 | Series, IMDb-addressable, so episode matching is exact. |
| **BitSearch** | 1 | DHT index, clean JSON API. Formerly SolidTorrents — the old domain now 301s here. |
| **Nyaa** | 1 | Anime, via RSS. |
| **The Pirate Bay** | 2 | Via `apibay.org`. Blocked for server-side clients by TLS fingerprinting — needs a proxy. Knaben already indexes TPB, so you rarely lose anything. |
| **AniTosho** | 2 | Anime mirrors. |
| **RARBG** | 2 | Off by default — heavily rate limited. |
| **Torznab** | 3 | **Jackett, Prowlarr, or any Newznab feed.** One URL can unlock hundreds of indexers. |
| **Prowlarr** | 3 | Prowlarr's aggregate JSON search endpoint. |

Providers fail independently. If Cloudflare blocks three of them from your region, the other seven
still answer and the request still succeeds. Use **Test all sources** in step 2 to see exactly which
ones work from your deployment.

## Why a link played the wrong thing

Most sources search by **title text**, not by ID. A search for "Dune" returns Dune (1984),
"Dune: Part Two", "Dune Drifter", and a pile of unrelated uploads. If nothing checks the
result, the addon happily plays whichever one ranked highest. Three filters stop that.

**Exact title and year** (`strictMatch`, on by default). The release name is parsed into a
title and a year, then compared with what you actually clicked. Token-set equality — not
substring — because substring is exactly how "Dune" matches "Dune: Part Two". Edition words
(`Extended`, `IMAX`, `Unrated`) are tolerated; extra words are not.

Two parsing traps this has to survive:

- `Blade.Runner.2049.2017.1080p` — the first four-digit number is part of the **title**, not
  the year. Title and year are resolved together so `2049` is not eaten.
- `1917.2019.1080p` — same shape, opposite answer: `1917` *is* the title. A number only counts
  as the year if it could plausibly be one and is not the only thing left.

**Junk and impossible sizes.** Executables, password dumps and URL spam are dropped. So is a
"4K" release under 600 MB — that is not a 4K movie, it is a sample or a fake. Series episodes
get lower floors because they are shorter, and unknown sizes are never rejected.

**Unreleased content** (`hideUnreleased`, on by default). If the film has not opened, or the
episode has not aired, then *every* result claiming to be it is fake. The scrape is skipped
entirely and the stream list says why instead of showing CAM rips.

### The one that was silent

EZTV is IMDb-addressable, which should make it the most accurate series source. It was
returning whatever aired last night instead — for every show.

The API keys its index by the **numeric** part of the IMDb id. Sending `tt0903747` is not
rejected; it is ignored, and the response is the entire global catalogue — about 1.1 million
torrents — with a normal `200`. `0903747` filters correctly. A 403 would have been obvious;
this looked like success, and it is why a series request could play an unrelated show.

The provider now sends the numeric id and rejects any response whose count is implausibly
large for one show, so a future change in that API fails loudly instead of quietly.

---

## Troubleshooting a source that returns 0

A source reporting `0` is not one problem. The probe classifies each failure, so you can tell them
apart instead of guessing:

| Reason | What it means | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `cloudflare` | The site fingerprints the **TLS handshake** (JA3/JA4) and refuses non-browser clients. | Proxy, FlareSolverr, or Prowlarr. Headers will not help. |
| `blocked` | A plain 403/401 with no bot-check markers. | IP or region ban, or the source now needs a key. |
| `rate-limit` | 429, or 403 with `Retry-After`. | Back off; it works, just slowly. |
| `missing` | 404 on the endpoint. | The API or domain changed. |
| `timeout` | No response within the budget. | Slow host, or blocked at the network level. |
| `empty` | Reached and answered, but had no matches. | **Working.** Keep it enabled. |
| `parse` | Got HTML where JSON was expected. | Usually a challenge page in disguise. |

### Why "HTTP 403 — Cloudflare" is often misdiagnosed

Two cases came up while building this, and both looked identical from the outside:

**1. It was a rename, not a block.** `solidtorrents.to` stopped being the real host. The probe saw a
failure and blamed Cloudflare; the actual cause was a redirect to a new domain. The fix was to point
at the new host — now `BitSearch`. Redirects are followed silently, so the failure is annotated with
the host that *actually* failed:

```
Cloudflare bot check (after redirecting to bitsearch.eu) — TLS fingerprint, not headers.
```

**2. The same URL answers differently per client.** This is the tell that it really is fingerprinting:

| Client → `apibay.org` | Result |
|---|---|
| `curl` (same IP, same User-Agent) | **200 OK**, real JSON |
| Node `fetch` (same IP, same User-Agent) | **403**, `<title>Just a moment...</title>` |

Same IP, same headers, different TLS stack. Setting Chrome's `ciphers` and `ecdhCurve` on
`https.request` still returns 403. There is no server-side fix — the decision happens below HTTP.
Use a proxy (field in step 2) or let Knaben cover that catalogue, since Knaben already indexes TPB.

**Quick check for any suspect source:**

```bash
curl -sS -o /dev/null -D - -A "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 \
  (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/124.0.0.0 Safari/537.36" "https://apibay.org/q.php?q=inception&cat=0" \
  | grep -iE "^HTTP/|cf-mitigated|^location"
```

- `200` + JSON in the body → the host is fine; your runtime is being fingerprinted.
- `403` + `cf-mitigated: challenge` → Cloudflare, needs a proxy.
- `301` + `location:` → the domain moved. Follow it.

## HTTP routes

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /manifest.json` | Default manifest (P2P, no key) |
| `GET /<config>/manifest.json` | Personalised manifest |
| `GET /<config>/stream/<movie\|series>/<id>.json` | Stream list |
| `GET /r/<infohash>?c=<config>` | Lazy resolve → 302 to a direct link |
| `GET /health` | Status, per-source success rates, debrid services |
| `POST /api/config` | `{action:"encode"}` · `{action:"verify"}` · `{action:"probe"}` |

Responses include an `x-hydra-stats` header with per-provider counts and timing, useful when
debugging a source that stopped working.

---

## Security and privacy

- **No server-side storage.** There is no database and no user account. Your key lives inside your
  own URL and nowhere else.
- **No password collection.** “Direct Install” uses the `stremio://` deep link, so Hydra never asks
  for — or sees — a Stremio account.
- **No video proxying.** Hydra never handles a byte of media. Debrid links go straight from the
  service to your player; P2P traffic goes straight from peers to your player.
- **Opaque URLs (optional).** With `CONFIG_SECRET` set, the config blob is AES-256-GCM encrypted.
  Without it, it is deflate-compressed and base64url-encoded — readable by anyone who sees the URL,
  the same trade-off every addon of this kind makes.
- **P2P exposes your IP** to other peers in the swarm. That is inherent to BitTorrent, not to this
  addon. Use a VPN if that matters, or stay in `debrid` mode.

---

## Free proxy for blocked sources

A TLS-fingerprint block cannot be fixed in the addon — the request has to come from
somewhere else. That normally means a proxy, which normally means something to host.
This is the exception: a Cloudflare Worker, on the free plan, with nothing to run.

**No card, no server, no Prowlarr, no domain.** 100,000 requests a day is the free
allowance, and one stream request is one call.

### Deploy it (about two minutes, no tooling)

1. Go to **dash.cloudflare.com → Workers & Pages → Create → Worker**.
2. Replace the starter code with [`worker/index.mjs`](./worker/index.mjs), then **Deploy**.
3. Note the URL it gives you: `https://<name>.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev`.
4. Open **`<that-url>/__check`** in a browser.

Step 4 is the important one. It makes the Worker test the trackers *from its own
network* and tells you whether the block is actually bypassed:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "working": 4,
  "total": 4,
  "results": [
    { "name": "TPB (apibay)", "status": 200, "ok": true, "bytes": 8421 },
    { "name": "BitSearch",    "status": 200, "ok": true },
    { "name": "Knaben",       "status": 200, "ok": true },
    { "name": "YTS",          "status": 200, "ok": true }
  ]
}
```

If `TPB` comes back `200`, the proxy is doing its job. Paste the Worker URL into
**step 2 of `/configure`** as the proxy and every blocked source routes through it.

### Or deploy with the CLI

```bash
cd worker
npx wrangler deploy
```

### It is not an open proxy

An unrestricted fetch endpoint is an SSRF hazard and an abuse magnet, so the target is
checked against an allowlist of tracker hosts — not "any URL". Host matching is
boundary-aware, so `evil-apibay.org` and `apibay.org.evil.com` are both rejected, and
private ranges like `169.254.169.254` never match in the first place.

To add a source, set `ALLOW_HOSTS` in `wrangler.toml` (or the dashboard):

```toml
[vars]
ALLOW_HOSTS = "apibay.org,my-tracker.example"
```

### What it accepts

All three shapes, so any proxy setting works:

| Form | Example |
|---|---|
| `?url=` | `https://<worker>/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapibay.org%2Fq.php%3Fq%3Ddune` |
| `/f/` | `https://<worker>/f/https%3A%2F%2Fapibay.org%2Fq.php%3Fq%3Ddune` |
| bare | `https://<worker>/https%3A%2F%2Fapibay.org%2Fq.php%3Fq%3Ddune` |

GET and POST are both forwarded — Knaben searches by POST, and a GET-only proxy would
report it healthy while every real search returned nothing. GET responses are cached at
the edge for 5 minutes to stay friendly to the trackers.

### If TPB still fails

You lose almost nothing. Knaben indexes The Pirate Bay and reports it as
`cachedOrigin: "The Pirate Bay"` in its own results, so that catalogue is already
covered by a source that needs no proxy at all.
